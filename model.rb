class Model

  #keep in mind the idea of thin controllers and fat models, with most of the hard work in the module
  #If program is a human
  #model is not just brain, it's all the internal organs
  #view is senses along with voice
  #controller is just nervous system, routing messages to the right places in the other two systems and very basic logic
